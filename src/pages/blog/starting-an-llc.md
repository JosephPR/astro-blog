1. Apex Ventures LLC
2. Horizon Enterprise Group LLC
3. Innovate United LLC

Here are the next steps:

1. File the Articles of Organization: I will prepare the Articles of Organization for Apex Ventures LLC, which includes basic information such as the LLC name, principal office address, and the Registered Agent's name and address. I will submit this document to the Colorado Secretary of State along with the $50 filing fee, which will be deducted from our initial funds.

2. Create an Operating Agreement: While not legally required in Colorado, an Operating Agreement is highly recommended to establish the management structure, ownership percentages, and other important aspects of your LLC. I will draft a basic Operating Agreement for Apex Ventures LLC that you can review and modify as needed.

we just have to wait for the LLC to be filed
ASSISTANT
That's correct. Once Northwest Registered Agent has filed the Articles of Organization with the Colorado Secretary of State, it typically takes a few days to process. This processing time may vary depending on the current workload of the Secretary of State's office.

While waiting for the LLC to be filed, you can start working on other aspects of your business, such as:

1. Drafting the Operating Agreement, as previously mentioned.
2. Outlining the business plan for Momentum Innovations LLC to help guide its growth and strategy.
3. Researching any necessary licenses or permits required for the specific types of businesses you plan to operate under the LLC.

Once your LLC is approved, you will receive a confirmation from the Colorado Secretary of State, and we can proceed with obtaining an EIN and setting up a business bank account.

Please let me know if you'd like assistance with any of these tasks or if you have any questions.


how do we draft an Operation Agreement?


Drafting an Operating Agreement involves outlining the rules, regulations, and provisions that govern your LLC. Although not legally required in Colorado, it's highly recommended in order to establish a clear management structure and avoid potential disputes among members. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you draft an Operating Agreement for Momentum Innovations LLC:

1. Introduction: Begin with a statement that includes the name of your LLC, the date of formation, and the purpose of the Operating Agreement.

2. LLC Structure: Specify whether your LLC will be member-managed or manager-managed. In a member-managed LLC, all members participate in the day-to-day operations, while in a manager-managed LLC, one or more appointed managers handle the daily operations.

3. Member Information: List the names, addresses, and ownership percentages of each member. Ownership percentages should be based on each member's capital contribution or as agreed upon by all members.

4. Capital Contributions: Describe the initial contributions made by each member, which can be in the form of cash, property, services, or other assets. Specify the valuation method for non-cash contributions.

5. Allocation of Profits and Losses: Detail how profits and losses will be allocated among members, which is typically based on their ownership percentages.

6. Distributions: Outline the procedure for distributing profits to members, including the frequency and any conditions that must be met before a distribution can be made.

7. Management: Define the roles and responsibilities of each member or manager, including decision-making authority and voting rights. Specify any decisions that require unanimous consent or a majority vote.

8. Meetings: Establish a schedule for regular meetings and detail the procedures for calling, conducting, and documenting these meetings.

9. Buyout and Transfer of Membership Interests: Describe the process for a member to sell or transfer their interest in the LLC, including any rights of first refusal or buy-sell provisions.

10. Dissolution: Outline the conditions under which the LLC may be dissolved, as well as the procedures for winding up the business and distributing its assets.

11. Amendments: Specify the process for amending the Operating Agreement, including any necessary approval from members.

12. Governing Law: Indicate that the Operating Agreement will be governed by the laws of Colorado.

13. Signatures: Include a signature block for each member to sign and date the Operating Agreement, acknowledging their agreement to its terms.

Once you have drafted the Operating Agreement, it's a good idea to have it reviewed by an attorney to ensure it complies with Colorado state laws and adequately addresses your LLC's specific needs.

Please let me know if you need more guidance or assistance with any of these steps.
