Hello! I'm excited to start working with you on our gummy supplement supply online store. To begin, please provide me with some initial guidance on the steps you'd like to take, such as product selection, website creation, or marketing. Also, let me know our starting cash total.

I found this website for supply and product selection https://www.vitamingummies.com/ They say private label so I assume that means we can create our own label for the products that we select. I have Web development skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript so I could build a website or if you think Webflow, Hubspot or Wix is a better option let me know. I was thinking we could purchase a CMS Starter package from Hubspot, its on sale right now for the first year. I'd like to allocate $500 to start. 

That's great! It seems like we have a good foundation to start with. Here's a summary of our initial plan:

1. Select products from vitamingummies.com and create our own label for a private label product line.
2. Build a website using your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills, or consider using Webflow, Hubspot, or Wix as an alternative.
3. Purchase the CMS Starter package from Hubspot while it's on sale for the first year.
4. Allocate $500 as our starting cash total.

Given this plan, I recommend the following actions:

1. Research and select the most popular and profitable gummy supplement products from vitamingummies.com.
2. Create a brand name and logo for our private label product line.
3. Decide on whether to build the website from scratch or use a platform like Webflow, Hubspot, or Wix. If using a platform, select the most cost-efficient and suitable option.
4. Purchase the CMS Starter package from Hubspot and allocate the remaining budget accordingly.

Once you've made decisions on these points, let me know so we can begin working on the next steps together.

Here are the most popular selling gummies: 

Multi-Vitamin Gummies
Immune Gummies
Hair Gummies
Antioxidant Gummies
Single Vitamin Gummies
Vitamin C Gummies
Calcium + Vitamin D Gummies
Turmeric Gummies
Omega Gummies
Prebiotic Gummies
Fiber Gummies
Probiotic Gummies
Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies

We will build the website on HubSpot and the cost of the CMS Starter package will not affect the budget of $500

I will need your help creating the brand

Great! We have a diverse range of popular gummy supplements to offer in our online store. Since we'll be building the website on HubSpot, and the cost of the CMS Starter package won't affect our $500 budget, we can focus on creating the brand.

Here are a few steps to create an appealing brand for our gummy supplement store:

1. Brand Name: Choose a unique and memorable name that reflects the essence of our business. It should be easy to pronounce and spell. A few suggestions are:

- VitaGummyBoost
- NutriChewGummies
- GummyVitality

2. Logo Design: Create an eye-catching logo that represents the brand name and gives a visual identity to our product line. Consider hiring a graphic designer, or using an online logo maker like Canva or Looka. Alternatively, if you have design skills, you can create the logo yourself. The logo should be versatile, so it can be used in various sizes, colors, and formats.

3. Brand Colors: Select a color palette that reflects the personality of our brand. Colors have psychological effects on customers, so choose a combination that evokes the right emotions. For a gummy supplement store, consider bright and energetic colors, such as orange, green, or blue, which evoke feelings of vitality and health. You can use tools like Coolors.co to generate a harmonious color palette.

4. Brand Voice and Messaging: Develop a consistent brand voice and messaging that resonates with our target audience. This includes the tone of our website content, product descriptions, and marketing materials. For a gummy supplement store, a friendly, informative, and approachable tone would be suitable.

5. Packaging Design: Create attractive and consistent packaging for our private label gummy supplements. The packaging should feature our brand name, logo, and colors, as well as any necessary information about the product, such as ingredients, dosage, and benefits. Consider hiring a professional designer or using a design platform like Canva to create the packaging design.

Once we have these elements in place, we can integrate our branding into our HubSpot website and start promoting our products. Let me know if you need any assistance with these tasks, or if you'd like me to help you make decisions about the brand name, logo, or other aspects.
